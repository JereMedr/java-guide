# Inheritance
Inheritance is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. It allows a new class to inherit properties and behaviors (fields and methods) from an existing class. This helps in code reusability, method overriding, and establishing a natural hierarchy between classes.

## Key Concepts in Java Inheritance
- Superclass (Parent Class): The class whose properties and methods are inherited by another class.
- Subclass (Child Class): The class that inherits properties and methods from another class.
- `extends` keyword: Used to establish an inheritance relationship between classes.
- Method Overriding: The subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
- `super` keyword: Refers to the superclass and can be used to access methods and constructors of the superclass.
