# Abstraction
 It is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. By abstracting away the complex details, abstraction helps to reduce complexity and allows the programmer to focus on interactions at a higher level.

 In Java, abstraction can be achieved through:

- Abstract Classes: These are classes that cannot be instantiated and are meant to be subclassed. An abstract class can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).
- Interfaces: These are reference types in Java that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Interfaces cannot contain an implementation of the methods (except for default methods and static methods).

## Key Points
### Abstract Classes:
- Cannot be instantiated.
- Can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).
- Used when classes share some common behavior but also define abstract behaviors that subclasses must implement.

### Interfaces:
- Cannot have instance fields or constructors.
- All methods in an interface are abstract by default (except default and static methods).
- A class can implement multiple interfaces, providing more flexibility than single inheritance with abstract classes.

## Benefits of Abstraction
- Reduces Complexity: By hiding complex details, abstraction allows the programmer to focus on high-level interactions.
- Increases Reusability: Abstract classes and interfaces allow for code reuse and a clear contract for implementation.
- Improves Maintainability: Changes to the implementation details are isolated and do not affect the code that uses the abstracted interface.
- Enhances Flexibility: Interfaces allow for multiple inheritance of type, enabling a class to implement multiple interfaces and be more flexible in its behavior.

### Summary
By using abstraction, we can define a common interface or abstract class that outlines the essential features of a concept, while allowing specific implementations to be defined in subclasses or implementing classes. This simplifies code maintenance and enhances flexibility.
