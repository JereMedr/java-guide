# Unchecked Exceptions:
Unchecked exceptions, also known as runtime exceptions, are not checked at compile-time. These exceptions can occur during the execution of a program and are not required to be caught or declared using the throws keyword.

Examples :

- ArithmeticException: This exception occurs when an arithmetic operation encounters an error, such as division by zero.
- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: This exception occurs when trying to access an invalid index in an array.
- IllegalArgumentException: This exception occurs when a method receives an illegal or inappropriate argument.
