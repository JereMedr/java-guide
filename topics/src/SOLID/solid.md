The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob. They form the foundation for writing clean and scalable code.

# S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that it should have only one job or responsibility. This principle aims to make classes more cohesive and less coupled.

# O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that the behavior of a module can be extended without modifying its source code.

# L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
-Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This ensures that a subclass can stand in for its superclass without causing errors.

# I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This principle promotes the creation of more specific interfaces rather than having one general-purpose interface.

# D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces). Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This principle aims to decouple software components to enhance flexibility and reusability.
