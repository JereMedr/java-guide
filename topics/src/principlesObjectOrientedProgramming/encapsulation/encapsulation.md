# Encapsulation
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming. It refers to the bundling of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. Encapsulation also involves restricting access to certain components to prevent the accidental modification of data. This is typically achieved using access modifiers such as private, protected, and public.

## Key Points of Encapsulation
- Data Hiding: By making variables private, you prevent external classes from accessing and modifying them directly. This is known as data hiding.
- Controlled Access: You provide public getter and setter methods to allow controlled access to the private variables. This allows you to validate and control how the variables are accessed or modified.
- Improves Maintainability: By restricting access, you can change the internal implementation of the class without affecting other parts of the program that use the class.
