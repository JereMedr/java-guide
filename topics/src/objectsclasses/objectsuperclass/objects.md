## In Java, `Object` is the superclass of all classes.
 This means that every class in Java is, directly or indirectly, a subclass of `Object`. As a result, any object in Java can be assigned to a variable of type `Object`.
## Most Common Use Case:
 The `Object` class is used to provide common functionalities that are inherited by all classes in Java. Some of the most common methods of the `Object` class include 
- toString()
- equals(Object obj)
- hashCode()
- getClass()
- etc. 
### These methods can be overridden in subclasses to customize their behavior as needed.
